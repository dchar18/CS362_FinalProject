# CS362_FinalProject
SMART RC Car

Description:
Build on the base of a Lamborghini Gallardo LP570-4 RC car, this car is stripped of all electronics (minus the motors) and replaced with 4 Arduinos that communicate using I2C Serial Communication. 

Ultimately, this car simulates collision-prevention systems present in modern cars by implementing 6 ultrasonic distance sensors located around the car.
